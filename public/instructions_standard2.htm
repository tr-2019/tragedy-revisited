      <em> And now, about the second part ... </em>
      In the second part of each round, the fisherwomen and -men are able to
      show their solidarity and donate some of their earnings to another player
      (2.5 ECU). If you do not like to do so, you are free to keep your hard-earned
      coins.
      <br><br>
      The mayor of the village encourages this friendly behavior by adding some
      money from the village's budget to each donation
      (The mayor adds another 1.5 ECU to the 2.5 ECU, which yields a donation of 4 ECU).
      In each round, you and two of your colleagues are matched randomly.
      One colleague will be able to donate to you (or not), right after that you
      will have the same choice and will be able to donate or not to your other colleague.
      If you donate, your earnings will be reduced by 2.5 ECU.
