      <br>
      This game is played by twelve human players (you and eleven other persons).
      All players are randomly distributed into two groups of six. Both groups
      play entirely autonomously, there is no interaction between members of
      different groups.
      <br><br>
      This game has six rounds. Every round consists of two separate decisions.
      <br><br>
      The scenario is as follows: You and the other players are fisherwomen or -men.
      You live together in a village, which unfortunately has no access to a coastline.
      However, right behind the hills, there is a small pond containing some exquisite fish.
      <br><br>
      In each round, you are first asked to decide how much you want to fish.
      You only have two options: Either fish a reasonable amount (5 Fish)
      or grab as much fish as you can (10 Fish).
      <br><br>
      You are free to choose, but be careful: If too many fish are caught by
      all fisherwomen and -men of the village, the fish population will go extinct.
      Once there are no fish left in the pond, you will not be able to continue fishing,
      even if there are some rounds left to play.
      <br><br>
      After every round, the fish population reproduces. Luckily, the amount of new-born fish
      after each round will always be exactly as high as the sum of caught fish by
      all six players, given that all six players chose the humble amount
      (6 Players * 5 Fish = 30 Fish).
      Thus: Every single decision to fish more will reduce the total population
      of fish forever.
